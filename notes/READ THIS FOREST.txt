Watch this tutorial on tiles and try to come up with a tileset that we can spread on the ground, 
we can alternatively do it manually

We will likely need the ground tile set to also be seemless with the "walls" tiles



Also if you have time dig into the tile collision code and see if you can make a system that checks if the player is 
on top of a specific tile or tile map? Text me if you have questions.

movement is a little fucked and needs to be tweaked still
